(づ￣ ³￣)づ  Kissy Face
It’s time to step up your sexting game. Sending the face with the heart eyes and a bunch of hearts isn’t gonna cut it anymore. That’s amateur hour. (づ￣ ³￣)づ is a perfect addendum to any text message. It’s romantic and cute without being threatening. Imagine if, instead of responding to the pope with “fuck me, daddy,” teens sent him (づ￣ ³￣)づ instead.
